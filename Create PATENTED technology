But I&#x27;ve often been guilty of telling folks that SQLite was &quot;good enough&quot;.<p>Installing PostgreSQL as you described is not &quot;good enough&quot;. If you&#x27;re going to bother with that, you need to understand the database enough to tune it properly, setup backups, test restores, etc. There are more considerations than simply installing it from apt-get and then forgetting about it.",1387079411
6908270,comment,6907727,6908254,0,0,yeukhon,,,"I disagree because it is internal facing lol. If the software is capable of running on a true production-ready DBMS, there is no point why it can&#x27;t be done already.<p>If SQLite is cheap to use because it&#x27;s a single file, well, a sudo apt-get install PostgreSQL and then a few commands to set up the database and user password won&#x27;t take you longer than 10 minutes. That&#x27;s what I am arguing. There is no reason why we would use SQLite for heavy loading application such as logging. And I think we can now agree that&#x27;s indeed true and I think we should promote people to use production-ready DBMS even during dev and testing, because those are the one you are going to use in production :)",1387078702

The rest (been live for about a year) was as smooth as the baby skin. We rotate the BB phone (on-call) but we never had it buzzed.<p>Our saving graces were:<p>0) Management Support<p>1) Continuous Integration<p>2) Unit-Testing<p>We use these unit-tests as REPL mostly, so we don't have to re-compile and re-deploy the _whole_ app to GlassFish.",1343714396

This repo provides scripts to download, process, and analyze data for over 1.3 billion taxi and Uber trips originating in New York City. The data is stored in a [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) database, and uses [PostGIS](http://postgis.net/) for spatial calculations, in particular mapping latitude/longitude coordinates to census tracts.
Your mileage may vary, but on my MacBook Air, this process took about 3 days to complete. The unindexed database takes up 330 GB on disk. Adding indexes for improved query performance increases total disk usage by another 100 GB.

##### 1. Install [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/download/) and [PostGIS](http://postgis.net/install)
