Using packages within the Tidyverse for your analysis will make your scripts easier to read for others and the future you. Recommended packages Loading data readr Load data from text files: tab, comma, and other delimited files. readxl Load data from Excel. RODBC Load data from Access and Oracle databases such as DELTA. RMySQL, RPostgresSQL, and RSQLite Connect to SQL databases. rvest Read and scrape content from webpages. pdftools Read PDF documents. googledrive Read and write files to your Google Drive. foreign Load data from Minitab and Systat. R.matlab Load data from Matlab. haven Load data from SAS, SPSS, and Stata. Manipulate data dplyr Essential shortcuts to subset, summarize, rearrange, and join data sets. tidyr Reshape tables and unpack multiple inputs stored in single cell. stringr Tools to edit and clean text and character strings. lubridate Tools to format dates and perform calculations based on time. forcats Set, re-order and change levels of factors (ordered character variables). magrittr Simplify your scripts by chaining multiple commands together with the pipe %&gt;%. Charts and visuals ggplot2 Essential package for plots and charts. ggsave Export charts in various formats and sizes. xkcd, hrbrthemes , ggpomological, ggthemes Chart themes for ggplot. viridis, wesanderson, ghibli Color palettes. rmarkdown Write summary reports and save as PDF, Word document, presentation, or website. shiny Create interactive data exploration tools for the web.

Files and folders here Simplify file paths in your scripts and functions. fs Command line functions for copying, moving, and deleting files. Automation cronR Schedule scripts to run and refresh data at a set time. Create R packages devtools Essential tools for creating your own R package. roxygen2 A quick way to document your R packages. usethis Shortcuts for package development and Github integration. goodpractice Automated feedback on your R package. Find new packages Install the Addin CRANsearcher to browse all published packages. Visit rOpenSci to view a selection of peer reviewed science packages. 1.2 Keep R updated Get the installr package install.packages(&#39;installr&#39;) library(&#39;installr&#39;) Update your R version updateR() When a popup suggests closing RStudio and running the update from RGUI, click NO. When asked whether to copy and update all of your packages. Click Yes. This will save you buckets of time. To learn more about installr see https://github.com/talgalili/installr/#readme. 1.3 Script organization The following tips will help make your R scripts easier to read and easier for others to use your code in their own projects. Add a description to the top of your script. Load all packages at the top of the script. Assign important file paths and parameters near the top of the script. Avoid changing working directories with setwd(). Save files to a local working directory such as &quot;~\\results.csv&quot;, rather than to a fixed location, such as X:\\EAO\\Air Data\\Project1\\results.csv. Load usernames and passwords from a file such as credentials.csv. An example R script # name_of_script.R # Purpose: This script does amazing things. # Assumptions: The monitoring data for the sites is from different years, # but we compare them anyways. # Warning! Don&#39;t use this script for Kryptonite. It will break everything. # Load packages library(dplyr) library(readr) # Set parameters year &lt;- 2017 data_file &lt;- &quot;monitors 1 and 2.csv&quot; # Load data air_data &lt;- read_csv(data_file) # My functions calc_stat &lt;- function(data) { new_stat &lt;- step1(data) %&gt;% step2() %&gt;% step3() } # My analysis results &lt;- air_data %&gt;% summarize(stat = calc_stat(concentration)) # Save results to local folder write_csv(results, &quot;results/summary_results.csv&quot;) 1.4 Divide and conquer For complex analysis projects many small components are often better than one big super script. As much as possible, try to create small functions to perform each task within in your analysis. If it’s a function that you will use across multiple projects, it is often helpful to save the function to it’s own script. These functions will become reusable building blocks that both future you and others can apply to their own projects. Using an R Markdown document is an additional way you can split your project into manageable steps. R Markdown makes it easier to include a short description of each step of your analysis. In fact, you are reading an R Markdown document now. An example folder structure for a project is shown below: New_Project\\ data monitors 1 and 2.csv R load_data.R calc_ucl95.R lil_boot_function.R summary_report.RMD results summary_results.csv summary_report.pdf 1.5 Codebooks, metadata, and data dictionaries A codebook provides essential technical details and references for the variables in a dataset. The codebook ensures someone unfamiliar with your data will have the necessary information to complete their analysis and help them to estimate the uncertainty of their results. An R package named dataMaid is available to assist with creating documentation for your data sets. An example codebook generated with dataMaid library(dataMaid) library(readr) data &lt;- read_csv(&#39;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MPCA-air/air-methods/master/airtoxics_data_2009_2013.csv&#39;) names(data) &lt;- c(&quot;aqs_id&quot;, &quot;poc&quot;, &quot;param_code&quot;, &quot;date&quot;, &quot;conc&quot;, &quot;null_code&quot;, &quot;md_limit&quot;, &quot;pollutant&quot;, &quot;year&quot;, &quot;cas&quot;) attr(data$aqs_id, &quot;labels&quot;) &lt;- &quot;Monitor ID&quot; attr(data$aqs_id, &quot;shortDescription&quot;) &lt;- &quot;EPA assigned monitor ID for the national Air Quality System (AQS).&quot; makeCodebook(data, vol = 1, reportTitle = &quot;Codebook for air toxics monitoring data&quot;, replace = TRUE) 1.6 Data formatting Performing similar analysis on multiple pollutants at multiple sites over multiple years becomes much easier when data is in a consistent format. MPCA prefers tidy data where each result has its own row in a table. More information on tidy data can be found here: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html. For monitoring data, each row should contain a separate column for: monitoring site ID Preferably the ASQ ID or other unique identifier parameter code In some cases other identifiers for pollutants may be used such as CAS or the analyte name, but the identifier should be unique to each analyte in the data POC For collocated monitors; if there are no collocated monitors in your data then you can include a POC column with all values set to 1 sample date Recommended format is yyyymmdd or yyyy-mm-dd; other formats can be converted using R’s lubridate package sample start time Format is hh:mm:ss sample duration Code for duration or numeric value of duration result Observed value null data code Example Tidy data Additional columns may include qualifier codes and method detection limits. Fields directly associated with one or more of the columns above can be removed and stored in their own tables whenever possible. For example, the site address and site name are both fields that are directly associated with the monitor’s AQS ID. If your data file already has the AQS ID column, you can perform all analysis based on AQS ID and then join the site information after the analysis is completed. EPA’s AQS data is stored in a recommended format for air monitoring data, as it meets all of the requirements for tidy data. The R functions shown in this guide often group and sort based on the columns identified above. Including these columns in your data will allow you to apply these functions in your own scripts as-is. Keep in mind that you may need to rearrange your data depending on its original format. For example, you may have multiple result columns (e.g. a separate column for each site’s results) and you will want to reorganize the data so that all of the results are in a single column. The gather() function in R’s tidyr package works well for this purpose. The mutate() function in R’s dplyr package can add and manipulate columns. The functions rename() and names(_) can update column names to make data compatible with the examples in this guide. 1.7 Pollutant names Pollutants often go by different names depending on the context. To prevent confusion it helps to include a unique CAS # or parameter code in your analysis results and summary data. If you are working with monitoring data that is missing a unique identifier for each pollutant, an R package named aircas is available to help join CAS numbers to pollutant names. "],

Pleas=\ne=20\ncheck my facts, I'd love to know if I'm wrong.\n\nSome of that reiserfs performance came from directories-as-hash-tables, whi=\nch=20\nI believe ext3/4 supports and is native for btrfs.  Some of that also came=\n=20\nfrom tail-packing, which could come from the extents feature of ext4 and=20\nshould be in btrfs.  The final edge reiserfs had was above-average=20\nflushing/caching algorithms, and the development pushes in ext4 and btrfs h=\nave=20\nlikely reduced or eliminated that; I think the unified block-device caching=\n=20\nsystem in the kernel able helped make that not such a big deal.\n\n> I'm a Reiser3 user myself, and I've never had any problems with it.\n>=20\n> (The trouble with it being \"long in the tooth\" is mostly hypothetical,\n> isn't it?)\n\nNot really.  Reiserfs will probably be maintained in the kernel for a very=\n=20\nlong time, in that as any interfaces it uses are updated it will be updated=\n to=20\nuse the new interface.  However, ISTR there are open bugs on reiserfs that=\n=20\nwill not be fixed.  Similarly, I expect new bugs that can be blamed on the=\n=20\nreiserfs code are less likely to be fixed than bugs than can be blamed on t=\nhe=20\next2/3/4 or xfs code.\n\nIn addition, as file system technology advances, reiserfs will become less=\n=20\nattractive for new installs and it will become more attractive to migrate a=\nway=20\nfrom it.  Unfortunately, migration tools are unlikely to be developed, outs=\nide=20\nof generic file system migration tools.  Compare with btrfs_convert which=20\nallows an ext2/3 file system to be converted to btrfs with no data copying;=\n=20\nsuch tools have to be aware of the internal structure of the file system an=\nd=20\nfewer and fewer developers will even HAVE that knowledge of reiserfs.  The=\n=20\nsource will be available, sure, but even kernel maintainers interested in f=\nile=20\nsystems are not interested in reiserfs.\n\nThere's no drop-dead date for reiserfs in the kernel (AFAIK), so there's no=\n=20\npressing need to migrate away from it, but there is a lot of work on file=20\nsystems that should both perform better and be supported better than reiser=\nfs.\n=2D-=20\nBoyd Stephen Smith Jr.           \t ,=3D ,-_-. =3D.\nbss@iguanasuicide.net            \t((_/)o o(\\_))\nICQ: 514984 YM/AIM: DaTwinkDaddy \t `-'(. .)`-'\nhttp://iguanasuicide.net/        \t     \\_/\n ": "not_spam", "We got ur email address from opt-in list,if its a mistake pls stop and=\n dont read on\nsprry,tq\nif no\nPlease read on\nTQ\n\nPart/Full-time.Work and get paid by us from anywhere.Flexible hours.Go=\nod pay.No experience OK.Free training provided if needed.Interested pl=\nease now apply only to: tmhk99a@tm.net.my\npls dont email to hk99@pd.jaring.my\n\n ": "not_spam", "A lot of software for Windows and MAC OS in different languages!
