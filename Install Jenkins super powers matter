# tensorflow-gpu
#Author: Maede Zolanvari

This is a tutorial on how to install TensorFlow GPU on Windows 10.
One of my PC's is Dell Alienware with M240A1 GeForce GTX 1080, the other one is HP Envy with E225W-1920 GeForce GTX 1080.

1. The very first step is to make sure you have the right NVIDIA driver installed (the right version number), if you don’t make sure of it, you will have runtime errors at the very end.

I used to buy iPad only, but after Windows 8.1 I changed my mind. I have many iPads at home for my 7-year-old for the learning and entertainment purposes. However, I wish I could buy a notebook, both for my son and myself for productivity and project purposes, that can last the whole day without charging in between. And I've looked around the market for 2 years, today I finally found it at a very reasonable price point. I bought ASUS VivoTab one month ago and tested all sorts of functionality. It has been doing good, but not excellent. My son installed Minectaft Computer Version and it was running so slow that he couldn't even play it at all in the most desktop environment of Java Runtime/Virtual Machine.One month later now it comes to the market this little cute ASUS Transformer Book t100. To make sure its computing power, I went to Best Buy yesterday first to install Minecraft with Java and it runs perfectly smoothly, which means you can count on this tiny "Netbook" to do heavy-duty gaming or graphical design. At this price, you buy the fastest tablet in the marketplace, which sounds like a steal.And also, the full function keyboard can make you productivity suite run perfectly on the most portable machine. I've tried to buy a bluetooth keyboard and a bluetooth Mouse for my past ASUS VivoTab Smart ME400C, but it's very awkward and the bluetooth connection often lost from time to time. So, I decided next time I would like a tablet with the Original-But-Not-Bluetooth-Connection Keyboard.And this is it - ASUS T100, which is a fast computer even faster than my wife's working computer Thinkpad, with a free office pre-installed. Also I did a deep research and found 1080p is not good for Wireless Display function. 1366x768 resolution makes Wireless Display function work perfectly since 1080p Miracast Wi-Fi connection often drops due to several times larger real-time network data transfer than in the 1366x768 mode.Try to think, when you get in your office, your monitor, full-sized keyboard and mouse will be wirelessly connected to this fancy little cutie automatically; When you walk in a presentation room, you can use the big TV screen mounted on the wall in the mirroring mode as a second screen, wirelessly or via and HML-to-HDMI cable. When you go back home, your kid can unplug the keyboard to play Windows-Specific tablet games or just leave the original keyboard plugged to play tons of Legacy Online Java-based Learning Games.At this price, basically you got a so-far-the-fastest tablet, a free original keyboard, a free Office, sounds too good to be true. Actually, in terms of Wireless Display function, I got a better notebook on ASUS t100 even than my 14" HP notebook with an I3 core, because my I3 HP hotebook processor can't support Wireless Display function at all.After I placed this order, I went to eBay buying a Samsung Pro 64GB micro SDXC for just a measly $21, then I got 128GB tablet+keyboard+Office in total so that I can download any youtube kids learning stuff as my son wants. For iPad Air at 128GB with a keyboard, you have to pay more than $1000, but it's still a toy, not as open as in the Windows Legacy platform. But this ASUS t100 can get my Word, Excel and Powerpoint jobs done on the go with my Verizon LG G2 phone's hotspot function anywhere anytime.Without Microsoft's distressed support, ASUS can't release a good product like this, because Microsoft is spending $400 million promotion to sell 16 million tablets like this over this holiday season. Compared to iPad Air, you only pay 1/3 price but can strike a good balance between home entertainment and work productivity.By the way, don't think the highest screen resolution is boon for customers all the times: I bought iPad 3 and it stutters once for every 5 minutes or so lasting almost an entire year and then Apple upgraded iOS three times I feel better, but after Apple forced me to upgrade to iOS 7, my iPad 3 stutters again now. I dug into the stuttering reason, I found it's the GPU/CPU A6X computing power issue, because iPad 3 uses 2048x1536 resolution, but its GPU is too slow to support, it can only run games at less than 30fps at ~17fps, making the stuttering issue happen all the time from day one. And Apple's Lemon Design has damaged Apple's reputation a bit and Apple has dumped iPad 3 like S***, making it the shortest-lived product in Apple's history.The only downside is the touch pad works not good enough. Because notebook at this small form factor, ASUS has combined two touchpad keys into one piece: this makes touchpad work stickily. You can try to lift your thumb higher to not touch he touchpad when you use your index finger to move the cursor around. Or you just plugin a USB mouse to solve this issue forever.Also, the full-sized USB port is very useful since past microUSB port can't read normal USB portable hard drive because tablet microUSB has no power output to power up a normal mechanical drive. Now, I'm waiting Intel-powered next generation phone so that Microsoft can combine Windows, RT and Phone three together into one product. By then, I guess within a few years, your phone will have a computing power simply as powerful as a desktop so that you can carry your pocket super computer anywhere anytime with a 24/7 wireless connection.To cut the price tag down, ASUS did cut a lot of functions: compared to past version Vivotab Smart, it lacks rear camera and many sensors like NFC Gyro... All in all, this will become ASUS's next Nexus 7 blockbuster, consolidating its No.3 position in the tablet world in the global market.

Theres many more problems that can happen but I think you already get my point.GOALS: 1) Don't use your Main MS Account as an\" Adminitrator\" but instead \"standard\"  2) Create a secondary account called \"local account\" and set that up as the Administrator instead.Account Management: steps creating a local account(administrator) and MS Account(standard)Charms search: type\"control panel\" > \"User's Accounts and Family Safety\" > \"Remove User account\" > \" Add a new user in PC settings \" located at bottom of window > Bringing you to Metro > click \"add Account\" > \"Sign in without MS accout\" located at bottom of page > \"Local Accout\" > create new user name and PWYou have 2 options on Signing IN1) Microsoft account or 2) Local Account1) Create or sign in with your MAIN Microsoft Account. If you already an MS account or uses windows phones/ xbox live or Hotmail/live/MSN email address you can use these as well to link those services to 1 master MS Account.2) Create a Local Account. Thise secondary account will not connect to MS's ecosytem but only in your local computer. I identical to USERS login on Windows 7,Vista,XP etc.Once you've setup these two accounts, you must set each account type to: >Change ACCOUNT TYPE for Main MS Account to \"Standard\"Change ACCOUNT TYPE for 2ndary Local Account to \"Administrator\"Please do these steps, it only takes 5minutes.  Its a small price to pay considering, it may  potentially rescue your entire data from a completely erasing your data after sending it for repairs.__________________________________________________________________________Making Back ups/ EtcAnother tip is to make a recovery image.First install Setup all your programs , setup your custom settings, etcAfter personalizing your PC.  > Its time to Create a Recovery Image right after you've set everything up.  This image will allow you to revert back to this pc's state in time, and in perfect working order.Sometimes system recovery doesn't solve your problems so having secondary backup plan like Recovery Image is key.________________________________________________________________________Not optional, must practice these 3 regular computing habits.#1  (Install McAfee Antivirus, which is now free starting 2014, per Intel's 2014 Keynote at CES) or Paid programs such as Kaspersky Internet Security 2014  is the leading software in the market today. $50.  These programs scans your system automatically, so set it and forget it.#2  (Install MalwareBytes/free, scan your pc every month with this program or sooner when you feel like your system is sluggish or seeing webpages poping up that you didnt click)  Because this is a free software, as a user you must manually start the scaning process or by buying retail version you'll unlock the auto scan scheduler feature.#3  (Install Superantispyware/free, Scan pc every 2wks)Because this is a free software, as a user you must manually start the scaning process or by buying retail version you'll unlock the auto scan scheduler feature.Its ok skip a few scans between months, although not advisable, especially if your a heavy web surfing maniac spending 2-3 hrs daily websurfing not just facebooking.  But please dont go without using all 3 programs more than 5-8 Months in between scans.________________________________________________________________________Another way to avoid  spreading your personal information out there into the wild unknowingly is to un-google yourself.yes ladies and gents! google or yahoo especially yahoo LOL..... but google is key here.Microsoft sells Primarily Software.Apple sells Primarily HardwareGoogle sells neither, that's why their products are so CHEAP, once they suckered in their backdoor ridden ecosystem, Google Inc. sells Primarily Everything about YOU!_____________________________________________________________________________________________________Steps in upgrading from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1  (2-3hrs)Key here is to ensure your windows 8 is fully updated before upgrading to win8.1Therefore repeatedly \"check of updates\" on windowsHow to upgrade to windows 8.1 for dummies.Step 1: Go to Metro and not desktopStep 2: Start typing : \"Control Panel\"Step 3: Click \"Windows Update\" > \"Check for Update\"Step 4: install updatesStep 5: restart computerStep 6: Repeat step 1 -5 until result \"no more updates\"Step 7: Run HP Update client, install all updates from HP to ensure all drivers and bugfixes are updated.( or whichever OEM you may have, lenovo,dell, sony etc.)Step 8: Uninstall your Antivirus Software (important) then RESTART PCStep 9: Go to Windows Store and upgrade to 8.1Step 10: leave computer on for 2hrs as it upgrades.Step 11: Repeat Steps 1 - 7Step 12: if you're not a complete fool, 8.1 upgrade should be straight forward. \\After steps 1-8 ONLY THEN you should install WIndows 8.1 at the marketplace. Goodluck.(note: steps above removes a lot of failures users experience after 8.1 update)___________________________________________________________Not many want to shell out their dollars on Office 360  if all they intend of using is standard word processors.you can use a free web version of office calledBing.com search:  \"MS Office Web Apps\"just sign in with the same  MS Account user name used on your PC.", "Date": "February 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Gift Laptop", "Author": "Samuel J.
