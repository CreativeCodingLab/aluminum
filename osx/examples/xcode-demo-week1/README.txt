Use this template to make a new XCode project. Copy the entire "xcode" folder to new folder in the aluminum/osx/examples directory. The source code for aluminum is editable directly inside this project (as long as the path is at the same level so that the XCode project can find "../../../../src/", where all of the aluminum source and header files live).
